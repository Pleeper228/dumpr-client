## Dumpr React App

Dumpr is a web application that allows users to create bathrooms with a brief description of the bathroom, a photo link, address and rating. You can also view all the bathrooms in hopes of finding a nice one near you!. Think Yelp for bathrooms!

---

This is the client side React app for Dumpr. It talks to an Express server and a Postgres database to store information. A link to the server repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Pleeper228/dumpr-server) and the deployed site can be found [here](https://dumpr-client.herokuapp.com).

To install locally make sure the the API server is running and that cors and fetch request urls have been update to match your local environment then just:
```
npm install
npm start
```

The app is now available!
